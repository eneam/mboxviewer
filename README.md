Installation
------------

MBox Viewer executable is released as mbox-viewer.exe-v1.0.3.XX.zip file. Please install zip file in selected folder and unzip the zip file.
This wil create mbox-viewer.exe-v1.0.3.XX subfolder under the selected folder. 
The mbox-viewer.exe-v1.0.3.XX subfolder will contain two executable files mboxview.exe or mboxview64.exe.

Configuration
-------------

MBox Viewer supports Windows Registry based and the file based configuration.

By default, Windows Registry is used to store configuration data.
During startup, the MBox Viewer will check whether the MBoxViewer.config file exists and is writeable in:

1. the Config subfolder under the MBox Viewer software installation folder  or
2. in the UMBoxViewer\Config subfolder under the  user specific folder created by Windows system 
        example : C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\UMBoxViewer\Config

The config file format is similar to the format of ".reg" registry file

```
[UMBoxViewer\LastSelection]
"parameter"="value"
```

White spaces are not allowed in the front of each line and around "=" character.
All parameter values are encoded as strings and converted by MBox Viewer to numbers or other data types when needed.

MBoxViewer.config file must be encoded as UTF16LE BOM file

MBoxViewer.config.sample file is included in the software package under the Config folder.
In order to enable MBox Viewer to use the file based configuration, 
user needs to rename this file to MBoxViewer.config file or copy the sample file
to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\UMBoxViewer\Config folder and rename.

Multiple Languages
------------------

MBox Viewer supports the multiple languages:

English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Portuguese-Brazil, Romanian, Polish, Japanese, Chinese-Simplified and Arabic.

GUI strings and documentation were translated from English to target languages using free Google Translation service and were not reviewed by humans yet. 
Free Google Translations are not domain specific and most likely they will need to be updated by humans.

By default English language is enabled. User can select different language during runtime by selecting 'Language->Select Language' option on the main menu.

Support for Arabic language is experimental. Looking for feedback from users fluent in English and Arabic.


Running
--------

Open created mbox-viewer.exe-v1.0.3.XX subfolder. Double left click on the mboxview.exe or mboxview64.exe file to start MBox Viewer. 
You will be asked to configure folder for all temporary files created by MBox Viewer.

On the main top tool bar, select the `File` option to open the drop menu and then select the `Select folder...` option. 
Browse to the folder containing one or more mbox and/or eml mail archive files and select it. All valid mail archive files will appear in the Mail Archive Tree window.

Left click on one of the archive files to load all mails within that archive.  Progress bar will appear and automatically close after the selected archive is fully processed. 
Mail header information of each email will appear in the Summary window. 
Note that parsing of very large archive file may take some time since the mail archives are text files and every character has to be examine one by one.  
However, subsequent loading of mails is done from the index file created by the mboxview during the initial parsing of the archive file and is much faster.
The created index file contains content meta data of each mail in the archive file. i.e. the mail header information and the position of each mail within the mail file for quick access to the mail message/body. 
The index files have the .mboxview extension.
	   
Left Click on one of the mails in the Summary window to show the Message/Body of that email in the Message window.
The mail retrieval state, total number of mails in the archive and the position of the selected mail within the archive is shown on the status bar.

Font Size
----------

User has an option to increase the font size of GUI objects if desired. On the main top menu tool bar, select the `File` option to open the drop menu and then select the `Font Config` option.
